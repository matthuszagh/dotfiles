#+title: dotfiles

* meta
This configuration has two primary goals: it should allow full
bootstrapping capabilities from a live USB containing this repository
(see the [[id:c2f11003-b5e9-48af-aa96-6fdf8a09eb32][bootstrapping]] section) and it should make it easy and safe to
switch between radically different configurations.

** limitations
Currently, this system only supports NixOS. Even though I plan to use
Nix as my primary driver, I'd like to be able to experiment with other
distros, notably Guix and Gentoo. I imagine the best way to do this is
to create separate BTRFS subvolumes.

** literate configuration
After originally having been totally convinced I'd use a single
literate config file for my entire dotfiles repo, I've finally decided
against it. Here's a pro/con list (wrt literate config) that led me to
this decision:

Pros:
1. It keeps documentation and code side-by-side, which potentially
   makes it easier to understand chosen configurations.

Cons:
1. They add a layer of complexity when something goes wrong. For
   example, if there's an error in my Emacs config, I have to edit the
   files directly and then redo the edits in the literate config.
2. Programming tools are well-designed for traditional source
   directories, but not really for literate
   configs. Counterintuitively, this makes literate configurations
   somewhat harder to navigate than traditional source directories
   (jump to definition etc don't work, just simple searches). Of
   course, you can get all of these things to work, but you need to
   leave the literate config to do so. It just feels like you're
   splitting yourself across separate systems.
3. Literate configs require a fair amount of prerequisite software to
   work, whereas traditional source dirs just need vim and a terminal
   if all else fails.
4. The adjacency of documentation and source code is not as good as it
   sounds. In order to avoid a complex web of code fragments that your
   tools can't navigate, you need to keep code chunks large. So, if
   you want to document things with a high-level of granularity you
   need to use code comments anyway. The larger literate documentation
   sections are not too different from READMEs at the end of the day.

* structure
** machines
Computer-specific configurations.

** config
Software configurations.

** scripts
Bash scripts to bootstrap and configure a system and to perform
sysadmin functions.

Bootstrapping includes just about every aspect of system
configuration, including drive preparation (partitioning, setting up
filesystems, etc.). The only aspect of system configuration not
supported is the copying of private keys and passwords to a new
machine, since these should probably never be put online. However,
scripts are still provided to do this when 2 computers and a USB are
present (one computer contains the keys, the other is the new system).

All bootstrapping scripts are located under ~scripts\slash{}bootstrap~.
